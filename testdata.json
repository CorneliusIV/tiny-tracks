The band he brought and the songs they played for this winning Tiny Desk Concert made us all even prouder.\n\nNaia was chosen after we reviewed nearly 5,000 video entries. And the talent that came to us through all those submissions was astonishing. Naia Izumi won us over with his mind-boggling and unique style of guitar playing — a combination of tapping on the fingerboards and soul-filled whammy bar-note bending. And his multi-octave singing range blended so eloquently with his guitar stylings.\n\n\"Soft Spoken,\" the song he submitted, felt singular and unparalleled to our panel of judges which included past Tiny Desk contest winner Tarriona \"Tank\" Ball, Tiny Desk alum Sylvan Esso and Gaby Moreno, along with NPR family members Talia Schlanger (WXPN), Russ Borris (WFUV), Toki Wright (The Current) and the All Songs Considered team of Robin Hilton and myself. It's a song, as I hear it, that speaks to the power inherent in the gentle and quieter voices that are often drowned out by the outspoken and boisterous ones. Its title was originally \"Soft Spoken Woman\" and, as we later learned, Naia had identified as a woman for nearly seven years. More recently, as he said in an interview with Washingtonian Magazine, \"I'm not into that anymore because I just want to relax with biology and be comfortable with what I have.\"\n\nNaia is often a one-man band playing on the streets with a drum machine. But for his Tiny Desk Concert he brought bassist Adam Matijasevic and drummer Kynwyn Sterling. He'd met Kynwyn after submitting one of his songs to a math rock Facebook group. And that's the thing: Naia's music draws from so many spheres of sound. There's that punctual, rhythmic, mathematical pulse to what he does, but there's also a fluid, almost African Kalimba sound in there as well. They're two sounds I wouldn't often think of as coexisting.\n\nWe're about to go out on the road with Naia Izumi to 10 cities. We'll be joined by some of the other Contest entrants that captured our attention and they'll share the bill alongside Naia. And though there is only one Contest winner, we discovered so many other great talents that we hope to feature in the future.\n\nRemember that the spirit of the Contest is intended to bring out the best in you, to gather with friends and to create. Thank you for being a part of something so filled with magic. It was an honor to watch what you created.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Soft Spoken\"\n\"As It Comes\"\n\"Soul Gaze\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nNaia Izumi (vocals, guitar), Adam Matijasevic (bass), Kynwyn Sterling (drums)\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineers: Josh Rogosin, James Willetts; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Niki Walker, Beck Harlan; Production Assistant: CJ Riculan; Photo: Eslah Attar/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/42MiCMJ6DJU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/42MiCMJ6DJU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/42MiCMJ6DJU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/42MiCMJ6DJU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/42MiCMJ6DJU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"PLy2PCKGkKRVbn9Rsn99a4VhSGWI4SQrm5","position":0,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"42MiCMJ6DJU"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/ZJ9jIhFCxWF-7TvILRZuTsiCVy4\"","id":"UEx5MlBDS0drS1JWYm45UnNuOTlhNFZoU0dXSTRTUXJtNS4yODlGNEE0NkRGMEEzMEQy","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-03-11T21:01:32.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"2018 NPR Tiny Desk Contest Entry","description":"Lyrics...\n\nBack up, \nyou're crowding my space, \nhands off, \nit's under control, \neveryone, \nhas something to say, \nbut I'm tired of lending an ear, \n\nMove out of my way \n\nTheres too many chiefs in this tribe, \nthere's only room for one of us, \nonly room for one of us \n\nDon't judge, \na book by it's cover , \nlisten, \nand you will learn, \nI might be, \na softspoken person\nbut I'm aware of the power I haves, so \n\nMove out of my way \n\nTheres too many chiefs in this tribe, \nthere's only room for one of us, \nonly room for one of us 2x \n\neveryone's got a point \nand no one's right or wrong \nbut only I know my heart \nand I've got my best interest in mind \n\n.... \n\nTheres too many chiefs in this tribe, \nthere's only room for one of us, \nonly room for one of us \n2x","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nk8HEO_60ms/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nk8HEO_60ms/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nk8HEO_60ms/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nk8HEO_60ms/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nk8HEO_60ms/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"PLy2PCKGkKRVbn9Rsn99a4VhSGWI4SQrm5","position":1,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"nk8HEO_60ms"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/-KHQPyjTktzpkX_jJch_SQfxz8o\"","id":"UEx5MlBDS0drS1JWYm45UnNuOTlhNFZoU0dXSTRTUXJtNS4wMTcyMDhGQUE4NTIzM0Y5","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-03-11T21:01:45.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Tank And The Bangas: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Bob Boilen | March 10, 2017 — Out of over 6,000 entries — more submissions than we've ever received — Tank And The Bangas won, unanimously, this year's Tiny Desk Contest. I fully expected their victory performance here at NPR headquarters in D.C. to be celebratory. I didn't know we'd all end up in tears.\n\nThis band combines R&B with hip-hop's poetry and rollercoaster storytelling, with a flair and alchemy that could only come from New Orleans. Their winning song, \"Quick,\" mixes liquor and revenge — a sort of modern day take on a great folk tale, but peppered with their own idiosyncratic flair and humor. What I couldn't see, until they took over my desk, was the depth of their lyricism and the versatility of their players. At one moment fun-filled funk, the next laid-back jazz, rhythm-driven blues — and it all flows seamlessly. And it's fun to watch: There's a magic kinship between Tarriona \"Tank\" Ball and Anjelika \"Jelly\" Joseph as they share singing roles, like two best friends finishing one another's sentences.\n\nThis is the third year that NPR Music has put out a call in hopes of finding a shining star. I'm still amazed how, after sifting through thousands of videos from abundantly talented musicians, we can find a common winner amongst a range of judges with such different musical backgrounds. But in the end, my All Songs Considered co-host Robin Hilton, Trey Anastasio (Phish), Miguel, Anthony Hamilton, Ben Hopkins (PWR BTTM), BANKS, and folks who listen to an awful lot of music — NPR member station hosts Rita Houston (WFUV), Talia Schlanger (WXPN), Stas THEE Boss (KEXP) — and myself were all equally charmed, delighted and captivated.\n\nAnd so here it is, a chance to see an artist truly blossoming. It's just the beginning: A few years ago, for our first Contest, Fantastic Negrito won our hearts. This year he won a Grammy. Last year Gaelynn Lea, an unknown violinist, teacher and singer sent a video captured on a phone and won our affection and souls. A few weeks ago, her Tiny Desk Concert had been seen more than a million times. These days she's taken to the road, touring the world.\n\nTank And The Bangas will be hitting the road in April with NPR Music to find their new audience — I'll be along for the ride — visiting many of our member stations with help from those music-loving beer brewers at Lagunitas. I can't wait to see the reaction in these crowds' eyes, as they fill with wonder and tears like ours did, experiencing this band for the first time.\n\nSet List\n\"Boxes And Squares\"\n\"Quick\"\n\"Rollercoasters\"\n\nMusicians\nTarriona Tank Ball (vocals); Jelly Joseph (vocals); Merell Burkett Jr. (keys); Norman Spence II (keys); Joshua Johnson (drums); Jonathan Johnson (bass); Albert Allenback (saxophone)\n\nCredits\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Niki Walker; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Nick Michael, Bronson Arcuri, Morgan Noelle Smith; Production Assistants: A Noah Harrison, Ameeta Ganatra; Photo: Niki Walker/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QKzobTCIRDw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QKzobTCIRDw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QKzobTCIRDw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QKzobTCIRDw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QKzobTCIRDw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"PLy2PCKGkKRVbn9Rsn99a4VhSGWI4SQrm5","position":2,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"QKzobTCIRDw"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/l4KQ6KwXLeDSr1lPQ6uyrznakak\"","id":"UEx5MlBDS0drS1JWYm45UnNuOTlhNFZoU0dXSTRTUXJtNS41MjE1MkI0OTQ2QzJGNzNG","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-03-11T21:01:49.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Tank and The Bangas   NPR Tiny Desk Contest 2017","description":"NPR Tiny Desk Submission\n\nMerell Burket: Keys\nJonathan Johnson: Bass\nJoshua Johnson: Percussion\nAlbert Allenback: Saxophone\nAnjelika Joseph: BG Vocals\nTarriona Ball: Lead Vocals\n\n--\n\nFollow us on socials!\n\nWebsite: http://www.tankandthebangas.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TankAndTheBangas\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tankanddabangas\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tankandthebangas/\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/tankandthebangas\nSpotify: http://spoti.fi/2FaXPWZ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0zU-Jm87kzY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0zU-Jm87kzY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0zU-Jm87kzY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0zU-Jm87kzY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0zU-Jm87kzY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"PLy2PCKGkKRVbn9Rsn99a4VhSGWI4SQrm5","position":3,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"0zU-Jm87kzY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/2CJ-IcBC3BNIB2VsCMQBqwhtDdM\"","id":"UEx5MlBDS0drS1JWYm45UnNuOTlhNFZoU0dXSTRTUXJtNS4wOTA3OTZBNzVEMTUzOTMy","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-03-11T21:02:01.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Gaelynn Lea: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Gaelynn Lea, the winner of NPR's second annual Tiny Desk Contest, makes music like nobody else. Her sounds are steeped in the deep melodies of great Irish fiddle tunes, but her performance and singing style aren't traditional. More than 6,000 artists submitted videos in which they performed an original song behind a desk of their choosing with the hope of winning a chance to play a Tiny Desk concert at NPR. Gaelynn Lea was the overwhelming favorite of our six judges.\n\nAfter voting for Lea, I wanted to learn more about her and her remarkable talent. Following about a minute of just focusing on the desk, her video pans to a small woman in a wheelchair as she plays a violin she holds like a cello. Lea has brittle bone disease, which made it necessary for her to reinvent the ordinary — and, in this case, a way to play the fiddle.\n\nI also discovered, after selecting Gaelynn Lea, that she'd become friends with Alan Sparhawk of the band Low. Sparhawk first heard her perform at a farmers market in Duluth, Minn., where they both live. They've become friends who sometimes make music together, recording under the name The Murder Of Crows, so I also invited Sparhawk to join Gaelynn Lea for two of her four songs at this special Tiny Desk concert. There was hardly a dry eye.\n\nSet List:\n\"Someday We'll Linger In The Sun\"\n\"Southwind\"\n\"Bird Song\"\n\"Moment Of Bliss\"\n\nCredits:\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Niki Walker; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Kara Frame; Production Assistant: Jackson Sinnenberg; Photo: Colin Marshall/NPR.\n\nFor more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n6oSeODGmoQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n6oSeODGmoQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n6oSeODGmoQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n6oSeODGmoQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n6oSeODGmoQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"PLy2PCKGkKRVbn9Rsn99a4VhSGWI4SQrm5","position":4,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"n6oSeODGmoQ"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/U6PAjxsAf4i_9oZ0T0pb95bgD0U\"","id":"UEx5MlBDS0drS1JWYm45UnNuOTlhNFZoU0dXSTRTUXJtNS4xMkVGQjNCMUM1N0RFNEUx","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-03-11T21:02:04.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Gaelynn Lea: 2016 Tiny Desk Contest Submission","description":"This is an original song by Gaelynn Lea entitled \"Someday We'll Linger in the Sun\". Gaelynn Lea is a musician and public speaker from Duluth, MN. The layers of sound in this song were created by live looping, using only a JamMan Express Looper Pedal, an Orange Microamp and Gaelynn's violin.\n\nGaelynn Lea has been playing violin for over twenty years and performing in Northern Minnesota and Wisconsin since 2006. She has a congenital disability called Osteogenesis Imperfecta (Brittle Bones Disease) and because of her shortened limbs she plays her violin in an upright position like a tiny cello. Gaelynn is passionate about disability advocacy and authentic living and often does public speaking engagements on these topics. \n \nMORE ABOUT GAELYNN LEA:\n\nGaelynn Lea was NPR Music's 2016 Tiny Desk Contest Winner and has been touring nationally and internationally since October 2016. This song will be included on her upcoming album, \"Learning How to Stay\", which was recorded in Minneapolis, MN with the help of a full band. The new album will be released on September 7, 2018 and can be pre-ordered at GoFundMe.

As melodies pour from the strings, she sings these words in Spanish: \"On the verge of the soul, there is a red petal, attached to the skins of mortals.\" A few lines later in the song she continues, \"a fragile petal that drinks the water of the most cruel stories: children who have never heard a fairytale, lovers who love, dressed in regret.\" This is the sort of poetic tale that captured my heart amongst the thousands of entries I watched during the Tiny Desk Contest in 2018. Her song she submitted for the contest is called \"La Realidad.\"\n\nLau Noah's journey as a songwriter and guitarist occurred by happenstance. She was born in Reus, Spain barely a few hours drive from Barcelona. She speaks and now sings in Catalan, Spanish, English and sometimes Hebrew. She'd played piano growing up (never guitar) and left Spain for New York City five years ago while in her late teens.\n\nOn a visit to Montreal in 2016, Lau hoped to go to a Patrick Watson concert with friends. But the performance sold out and she was left alone in an apartment while her friends went to the show. Then a snowstorm ensued. The apartment had two guitars and, with nothing else to do, she picked one up and began to play. She wrote her first song, \"Pequitas,\" which means \"Little Freckles.\" Now, not too many years later, her creativity on both classical guitar, her narrative poetry and the singing of that poetry make the musician Lau Noah a unique spirit.\n\nBefore she played her final song, \"Red Bird,\" at the Tiny Desk, she quoted Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, from his novel Don Quixote: \"When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies,\" Lau said, reading from her notes. \"Perhaps to be too practical is madness. To surrender dreams is madness. And maddest of all: to see life as it is and not as it should be.\"\n\nLau Noah herself writes the kinds of story-songs that provoke that sort of thought, so we've included translations for you to fully enjoy her vision.\n\nSet List\n\"El Jardinero (The Gardener)\"\n\"La Realidad (The Reality)\"\n\"L'Adéu (The Goodbye)\"\n\"La Belleza (The Beauty)\"\n\"Red Bird\"\n\nCredits\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Kimani Oletu; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Photo: Amr Alfiky/NPR","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o4Abt48WxkA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o4Abt48WxkA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o4Abt48WxkA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o4Abt48WxkA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o4Abt48WxkA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"PLy2PCKGkKRVbn9Rsn99a4VhSGWI4SQrm5","position":8,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"o4Abt48WxkA"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/-oY7_uC2_IccwRGLRSF4tljUqmg\"","id":"UEx5MlBDS0drS1JWYm45UnNuOTlhNFZoU0dXSTRTUXJtNS5GNjNDRDREMDQxOThCMDQ2","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-03-11T21:04:14.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Lau Noah- La REALIDAD - Tiny Desk Contest 2018","description":"https://www.launoahmusic.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z-9iKBWSRDg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z-9iKBWSRDg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z-9iKBWSRDg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z-9iKBWSRDg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z-9iKBWSRDg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"PLy2PCKGkKRVbn9Rsn99a4VhSGWI4SQrm5","position":9,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"z-9iKBWSRDg"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/EN1A2fvUsT_jFHWCM5rtracH6OQ\"","id":"UEx5MlBDS0drS1JWYm45UnNuOTlhNFZoU0dXSTRTUXJtNS40NzZCMERDMjVEN0RFRThB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-03-11T21:04:28.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Hobo Johnson and The Lovemakers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Sept. 12, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- Hobo Johnson and the Lovemakers accomplished something remarkable this year with their Tiny Desk Contest entry. They made a simple backyard video - a single camera shoot - that's now been seen almost 10 million times on YouTube. And the song they played, \"Peach Scone,\" has unlocked a door to a dream - to play a Tiny Desk Concert and be heard. The song is a tale of one-sided love - a tale of kindness in the face of loneliness and depression. Now, \"a couple of kids - five I guess\" as its lyrics go, get to bring their creative, urgent and somewhat nervous energy from Sacramento, Calif. to play \"Peach Scone\" and more to millions of other listeners.\n\nThis is a band always on the verge of emotional explosions, all while Frank Lopes, aka Hobo Johnson, is quoting Shakespeare and making references to Jay-Z, The Front Bottoms song \"Twin Size Mattress\" and so much more.\n\nThe directness in their music, with its chorus shouts (\"Damn I love those sandwiches!\") and the little asides (\"I got a duvet the other day - how do you wash a blanket? In a washer? That's what I found out\") make for a remarkably personal performance. At times it's as much a storytelling session or personal confession than a musical performance, and for me it conjures feelings of empathy and understanding and compassion.\n\nSet List\n\"Romeo & Juliet\"\n\"Sex in the City\"\n\"Peach Scone\"\n\"Creve Coeur 1\"\n\nCredits\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Bronson Arcuri, CJ Riculan; Editor: Production Assistant: Ema Sagner; Photo: John Poole","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8a2EosJIbM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8a2EosJIbM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8a2EosJIbM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8a2EosJIbM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8a2EosJIbM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"PLy2PCKGkKRVbn9Rsn99a4VhSGWI4SQrm5","position":10,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"A8a2EosJIbM"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/UlJ8VkBYOko05q1wkyN_Nd64OjE\"","id":"UEx5MlBDS0drS1JWYm45UnNuOTlhNFZoU0dXSTRTUXJtNS5EMEEwRUY5M0RDRTU3NDJC","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-03-11T21:04:32.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Hobo Johnson & The LoveMakers - 2018 NPR Tiny Desk Contest (Peach Scone)","description":"from where I'm from, we use tables as desks.\nFind Peach Scone (studio & live) everywhere: http://smarturl.it/peachscone\n\n[Intro]\nSorry but- (Go ahead)\nOh no\nWhat up, Bob?

The Portland singer entered our Tiny Desk Contest three years in a row with strong, though often frail songs. And she'd be among the first to tell you how entering that Tiny Desk Contest changed her life.\n\nUnlike her solo acoustic contest entries, which are quiet, mostly solemn affairs, Haley Heynderickx came to NPR's Tiny Desk with her band: Denzel Mendoza on trombone, Lily Breshears on Moog bass, and Phil Rogers on drums. They opened with the song that is most out of character for Haley, a song she wrote as part of a song challenge and she challenged the crowd here at NPR to a sing-a-long. We didn't do so well, it was early in the day — but this song about self-doubt and searching for life's meaning with its cathartic phrase \"I need to start a garden\" (which is also the title to her 2018 debut) is a potent reminder to take action when life gets bewildering.\n\nThe second song, \"No Face,\" is a reminder to love people as kindly as you can; otherwise you'll wind up like the character No Face from the Hayao Miyazaki film Spirited Away. In introducing the final song, \"Worth It,\" Haley Heynderickx told the Tiny Desk crowd that it was written in a basement with the belief that it would never leave that basement. With this performance now behind her and the chance for hundreds of thousands of people to hear these personal but universal songs, there will be many of us, myself included, thrilled that her songs are out in the open, ready to be heard.\n\nSet List\n\"Oom Sha La La\"\n\"No Face\"\n\"Worth It\"\n\nMusicians\nHaley Heynderickx (vocals, guitar), Denzel Mendoza (trombone), Lily Breshears (Moog bass), Phil Rogers (drums)\n\nCredits\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, CJ Riculan, Maia Stern; Production Assistants: Catherine Zhang, Téa Mottolese; Photo: Eric Lee/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mub2i2BoHpM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mub2i2BoHpM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mub2i2BoHpM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mub2i2BoHpM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mub2i2BoHpM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"PLy2PCKGkKRVbn9Rsn99a4VhSGWI4SQrm5","position":12,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Mub2i2BoHpM"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/gmaBLR7fkNfRp_Tj_AhzSQSQgxc\"","id":"UEx5MlBDS0drS1JWYm45UnNuOTlhNFZoU0dXSTRTUXJtNS4zMDg5MkQ5MEVDMEM1NTg2","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-03-11T21:05:10.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"haley heynderickx - the bug collector (tiny desk contest 2017)","description":"Finished it just in the nick of time!

He's always been one of our favorites, though he's never been our winner. The double bassist entered his song, \"Begin Againers\" in 2016 and though it wasn't the winning entry, we all loved it so much, I invited him to my desk to perform his extraordinary song. He opened the Tiny Desk with it, only this time he was joined by bandmates Jesse Isley and Josh Shilling who shared vocal harmonies.\n\nScott Mulvahill honed his craft touring with the great bluegrass mandolin player Ricky Skaggs. \"Playing bluegrass with him is like playing jazz with Miles Davis,\" Scott told the Tiny Desk crowd.\n\n\nEach of the three tunes Scott Mulvahill played represents different aspects of his creative spirit. He challenges himself to find ways to use the bass as a solo instrument, but its most common role is to accompany others. So he brought his band along for his most rollicking song, \"Gold Plated Lie.\" There's a bit of Jackson Browne in his voice and a bit of Paul Simon shows through in his self-reflective words.\n\nFor the final tune, the title track from his self-released and current album Himalayas, Scott Mulvahill goes solo, brings out a bow for that bass and we hear a spaciousness I don't often find in the Nashville world he inhabits. This is a perfect introduction to an artist with enormous talent and an artist seeking to stretch his musical world.\n\nSet List\n\"Begin Againers\"\n\"Gold Plated Lie\"\n\"Himalayas\"\n\nMusicians\nScott Mulvahill: bass, vocals; Terence Clark: drums; Jesse Isley: guitar, vocals; Josh Shilling: keys, vocals; Gabe Scott: dobro\n\nCredits\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Kimani Oletu, Kara Frame; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Production Assistant: Adelaide Sandstrom; Photo: Amr Alfiky/NPR","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HwgV6MJneR8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HwgV6MJneR8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HwgV6MJneR8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HwgV6MJneR8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HwgV6MJneR8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"PLy2PCKGkKRVbn9Rsn99a4VhSGWI4SQrm5","position":14,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"HwgV6MJneR8"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/Efpv71U50_iptH80CSl1Or1g2nQ\"","id":"UEx5MlBDS0drS1JWYm45UnNuOTlhNFZoU0dXSTRTUXJtNS5EQUE1NTFDRjcwMDg0NEMz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-03-11T21:05:41.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Scott Mulvahill - One Way Road","description":"New Album HIMALAYAS Out Now!\nLISTEN | http://www.2lin.cc/scottmulvahill\n\nYou can look back, but you can't go.

I inevitably end up discovering so much wonderful music while going through the submissions.\n\nLast year I came across Kuinka (coo-WINK-uh), a band from Seattle, and fell in love. So, when we held a Tiny Desk party in Seattle last May, with our partner station KEXP, we invited Kuinka (and other local bands) to play. Kuinka's live performance knocked me out even more than the creative video they'd submitted for the contest.\n\nSince then, Brothers Zach and Nathan Hamer, along with Miranda Zickler and Jillian Walker, have come to D.C. for an official performance at the Tiny Desk, bringing with them their great harmonies and unique blend of energetic, string-band music with a dose of synth.\n\nThe songs are performed here on relatively tiny instruments, including a ukulele, a drum pad, a small synth, a mandolin and a banjo, along with an electric guitar. But the performance is fleshed out beautifully with rousing vocal harmonies.\n\nAll three tracks performed here are from Kuinka's 2017 EP Stay Up Late, and each one has its own charm. Make sure you stay to the end because \"Mistakenly Brave\" is the most stirring of the bunch.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Curious Hands\"\n\"Spaces\"\n\"Mistakenly Brave\"\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Beck Harlan, Dani Lyman; Editor: Beck Harlan; Production Assistant: Joshua Bote; Photo: Eslah Attar/NPR.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kWg2nMJkO5Y/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kWg2nMJkO5Y/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kWg2nMJkO5Y/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kWg2nMJkO5Y/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kWg2nMJkO5Y/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"PLy2PCKGkKRVbn9Rsn99a4VhSGWI4SQrm5","position":16,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"kWg2nMJkO5Y"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/Qd-vpCDviJnV8q6AeCThJdfTN_k\"","id":"UEx5MlBDS0drS1JWYm45UnNuOTlhNFZoU0dXSTRTUXJtNS4yMUQyQTQzMjRDNzMyQTMy","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-03-11T21:06:10.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Kuinka - \"Gold\" // NPR Tiny Desk Contest Submission 2017","description":"Kuinka plays \"Gold\" from their 2016 release “The Heartland” in an antique store, on some antiques.\n\nFilmed by Jennifer Seifried // http://www.seedandvinemedia.com\nEdited by Zach & Nathan Hamer\nSpecial thanks to Aladdin's Antiques & Records in Bellingham, WA // http://www.aladdinsantiquesandrecords...\n\nhttp://www.kuinkatheband.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9wqqK8xELh4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9wqqK8xELh4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9wqqK8xELh4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9wqqK8xELh4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9wqqK8xELh4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"PLy2PCKGkKRVbn9Rsn99a4VhSGWI4SQrm5","position":17,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"9wqqK8xELh4"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/ZXtILpStXifCNMmWsY_ORw1jZPM\"","id":"UEx5MlBDS0drS1JWYm45UnNuOTlhNFZoU0dXSTRTUXJtNS45RTgxNDRBMzUwRjQ0MDhC","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-03-11T21:06:25.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Bernie And The Believers Feat. Essence: Tiny Desk Concert","description":"Nov. 12, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- The story of Bernie and the Believers is the most powerful I've ever come across at the Tiny Desk. It's about a beautiful act of compassion that ultimately led to this performance, and left me and my coworkers in tears.\n\nI discovered the music of Bernie Dalton among the thousands of Tiny Desk Contest entries we received earlier this year. The band's singer, Essence Goldman, had submitted the entry and shared Bernie's story. You should hear her tell it in her own words at the Tiny Desk (and I choke up every time I hear it). In summary she said that a few years ago, Bernie — a father, a songwriter and a musician in his mid-forties, and an avid surfer with a day job as a pool cleaner — answered an ad she had posted offering voice lessons. Essence was a performer trying to manage her own career as a single mom, and Bernie was trying to improve his talents.\n\nBernie drove 90-minutes from Santa Cruz to San Francisco, eagerly showing up early to his voice lessons with Essence. But not long after they started working together, Bernie lost his voice. They didn't think much of a it at first, but then things got worse. He had trouble swallowing and eating. Essence encouraged Bernie to see a doctor and after some tests Bernie Dalton was diagnosed with bulbar-onset ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease. He began to lose the use of his hands and, along with it, the ability to play guitar.\n\nWith a prognosis of only one-to-three years left to live, Essence offered to raise money so that Bernie and his daughter could travel together. But what Bernie wanted more than anything was to make a record. So he asked Essence to not just be his voice teacher, but his voice. From there, they got to business. Essence pulled together a team of producers, engineers and musicians, while Bernie guided the creative direction through gestures and a dry-erase board. They wrote and recorded a new song every day. Their first single, \"Unusual Boy,\" was the one they included in their 2018 Tiny Desk Contest entry.\n\nNow Bernie's friends have gathered here in Washington, D.C. to perform his songs. All the while, Bernie watched and listened from his hospital bed on the West coast, communicating with us in a live video feed through his eye-gaze device. What you are about to witness is the ultimate act of love: Essence sacrificing her own musical ambitions to fulfill the dreams of Bernie Dalton. Through tragedy there was beauty.\n\nSet List\n\"Unusual Boy\"\n\"In Your Shoes\"\n\"Simon's Hero\"\n\nCredits\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Kaylee Domzalski, Beck Harlan; Editor: Production Assistant: Brie Martin; Photo: Cameron Pollack/NPR","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UPQsEoYHekg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UPQsEoYHekg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UPQsEoYHekg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UPQsEoYHekg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UPQsEoYHekg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"PLy2PCKGkKRVbn9Rsn99a4VhSGWI4SQrm5","position":18,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"UPQsEoYHekg"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/UDiXDsBQk8cjenQhNmR331nWTVo\"","id":"UEx5MlBDS0drS1JWYm45UnNuOTlhNFZoU0dXSTRTUXJtNS5ENDU4Q0M4RDExNzM1Mjcy","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-03-11T21:06:28.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"Bernie And The Believers NPR Tiny Desk Contest 2018","description":"Bernie & The Believers \"Unusual Boy\" \nFeaturing essence\n\nFrom the album \"Connection\" \nAVAILABLE NOW on iTUNES, Amazon, Spotify, and Google Play!\n\nLyrics written by Bernie Dalton\nMusic composed by Essence Goldman and Roger Rocha\n\nMusicians:\nEssence Golman: voice\nRoger Rocha: guitar\nDaniel Berkman: cello\nAdrienne Biggs: violin\n\nwww.BernieAndTheBelievers.com\n\nVideo Credits:\nDirected by: Ari Gold - http://www.AriGoldFilms.com\nFollow @AriGold on Instagram & Twitter\nSubscribe to: http://www.youtube.com/AriGoldFilms \nDirector of Photography: Will Truettner\nCameras: Will Truettner, Thayer Walker, Ari Gold\nLive on Location Sound Recording Engineer: David Simon-Baker\nLighting: Joe Mullen\nEditor: Kirk Goldberg\nMake-up: Elizabeth Chang\n\nLyrics:\nUnusual Boy\nCopyright Bernie Dalton, essence, Roger Rocha 2018\n\nAlways a boy loves me\nWhen I start to open\nAlways a boy leaves me\nWhen it’s not enough\n\nNever the right boy\nCan understand me\nNever the right boy\nTo own my heart\n\nOnly an unusual boy\nCould love and understand me\nIf only an unusual boy\nCould love me tonight\n\nI need an unusual boy\nTo continue to believe in me\nI need this unusual boy\nTo convince me to believe too\n\nSuch an unusual boy\nNot look I need attention\nSuch an unusual boy\nWe’re cut from the same cloth\n\nOnly an unusual boy\nCould love and understand me\nIf only an unusual boy\nCould hold me tonight\n\nLonging to tell him\nI have feelings for him\nLonging to say\nI can’t hold back anymore\nAfraid that I’ll that I’ll lose him\nBut equally afraid\nAfraid that he’ll say\nI just don’t see you that way\n\nOnly an unusual boy\nCould love and understand me\nAnd only an unusual boy\nCould love and understand me\nAnd I know an unusual boy\nAnd I think that he can handle me\nAnd I know an unusual boy\nI wish I could see him tonight\nCause I am the unusual girl\nI’m moving to the real me\nAnd I am the unusual girl\nWho feels, I feel so much more\nIf only an unusual boy\nWould choose to embrace me\nI know that my unusual boy\nHe could be Mr. Right.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Gv6FHEmbhY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Gv6FHEmbhY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Gv6FHEmbhY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Gv6FHEmbhY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Gv6FHEmbhY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"PLy2PCKGkKRVbn9Rsn99a4VhSGWI4SQrm5","position":19,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"8Gv6FHEmbhY"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/au2r8wMIoOIhmylds7MVNs9pP60\"","id":"UEx5MlBDS0drS1JWYm45UnNuOTlhNFZoU0dXSTRTUXJtNS4yMDhBMkNBNjRDMjQxQTg1","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-03-11T21:06:52.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"River Whyless: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","description":"January 19, 2016 by BOB BOILEN\n\nThis immensely talented band from Asheville, N.C., was my favorite discovery at this year's Americana Music Festival. River Whyless builds its music around fiddle, guitar and harmonies, with imagination and textures that set the band apart from many of its acoustic and folk-based peers.\n\nAt the Tiny Desk, River Whyless' members used a typewriter for rhythm, a toy piano for whimsy and a harmonium for mood, as well as a gong, multiple odd percussive accents and subtle guitar effects. There are hints of Paul Simon in their inflections and poetic phrasing, and their songs feel fresh and nicely crafted. \"Life Crisis\" is a song from 2015's self-titled EP, but the others are new to me; here's hoping we'll have a new album in 2016.\n\nRiver Whyless EP is available now:\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/river-whyless-ep/id954001466\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RCDJDRY?ie=UTF8&keywords=River%20Whyless&qid=1453209846&ref_=sr_1_1&s=dmusic&sr=1-1-mp3-albums-bar-strip-0\n\nSet List:\n\"Life Crisis\"\n\"Sailing Away\"\n\"Baby Brother\"\n\nCredits:\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Walker; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Walker, Niki Walker, Julia Reihs; Production Assistant: Kate Drozynski; photo by Jun Tsuboike/NPR\n\nFor more Tiny Desk Concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Iyzf1EKNyno/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Iyzf1EKNyno/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Iyzf1EKNyno/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Iyzf1EKNyno/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Iyzf1EKNyno/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"NPR Music","playlistId":"PLy2PCKGkKRVbn9Rsn99a4VhSGWI4SQrm5","position":20,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Iyzf1EKNyno"}}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/HyTJLnn5wDsBAEQgFr27t9Xs3pI\"","id":"UEx5MlBDS0drS1JWYm45UnNuOTlhNFZoU0dXSTRTUXJtNS5GM0Q3M0MzMzY5NTJFNTdE","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-03-11T21:07:01.000Z","channelId":"UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A","title":"River Whyless \"Life Crisis\"","description":"NPR Tiny Desk Submission\nRecorded in Alex's airstream\nDirected by Brock Scott\n\nWe recorded this at the beginning of October, before the Tiny Desk Contest was announced, for promo for our upcoming EP.
